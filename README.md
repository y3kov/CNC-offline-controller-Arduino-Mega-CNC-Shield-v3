PY_CNC

I am developing a firmware for a CNC milling machine for offline control and code sending.
Arduino MEGA 2560
CNC Shield v3
TFT display 1.8 + SD card reader
Encoder



What has been achieved so far is that the device responds to commands to move G0 G1.
It is positioned at G28 G28XY.
Reacts to the end caps.
Turning off and on the M17 M18 engines.
Automatic engine shutdown in idle mode.

Under development.
